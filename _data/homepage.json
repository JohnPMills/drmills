Some of my career highlights include: <br><br>* Creating the First Open Access Subject Repository for Sport, Exercise and Health related research called <a href=\"https://www.sportrxiv.org/\">SportRxiv</a> so everyone around the world has freely available access to the full texts of hundreds of research articles in my scholarly domain. <br><br>* Forming the <a href=\"https://www.storkinesiology.org/\">Society for Transparency, Openness, and Reproducibilty in Kinesiology</a> to solve the problem of how to fund and manage <a href=\"https://www.sportrxiv.org/\">SportRxiv</a>.<br><br> Some other problems I am currently working on include changing the academic culture around research integrity through open science at <a href=\"https://www.eur.nl/en\">Erasmus University Rotterdam</a>, and figuring out how best to support online gamers with their mental health at <a href=\"https://www.playaid.net/\">Play Aid</a>. <br><br>If you have a problem that you think I can help with, <a href=\"mailto:john@playaid.net/|\">drop me an email</a>.",
