  "homepage_text": "For the past 24-years, I have been attempting to make the complex simple and to support the development of young people. I am easily bored and am always looking for new challenges to keep life interesting. I consider myself a problem solver and some of the solutions I have found include: Creating the First Open Access Subject Repository for Sport, Exercise and Health related research called SportRxiv, and bringing together a group of scientists from around the world to form the Society for Transparency, Openness, and Reproducibilty in Kinesiology and build out from SportRxiv. Some other problems I am currently working on include changing the academic culture around research integrity through open science at Erasmus University Rotterdam, and figuring out how best to support online gamers with their mental health at Play Aid.\n\nIf you have a problem that you think I can help with, drop me an email."
