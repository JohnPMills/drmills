                  For the past 24-years, I have been attempting to make the complex simple and to support the development of young people. I am easily bored and am always looking for new challenges to keep life interesting. I consider myself a problem solver and some of the solutions I have found include: Creating the First Open Access Subject Repository for Sport, Exercise and Health related research called [SportRxiv](https://sportrxiv.org), and bringing together a group of scientists from around the world to form the [Society for Transparency, Openness, and Reproducibilty in Kinesiology](https://storkinesiology.org) and build out from SportRxiv. Some other problems I am currently working on include changing the academic culture around research integrity through open science at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en/egsh/course/open-science-and-research-transparency), and figuring out how best to support online gamers with their mental health at [Play Aid](https://playaid.net).
If you have a problem that you think I can help with, [drop me an email](mailto:{{ drjpmills@gmail.com }})
