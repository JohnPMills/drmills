Some of my career highlights include: <br><br>* Creating the First Open Access Subject Repository for Sport, Exercise and Health related research called <a href=\"https://www.sportrxiv.org/\">SportRxiv</a> so everyone around the world has freely available access to the full texts of hundreds of research articles in my scholarly domain. <br><br>* Forming the <a href=\"https://www.storkinesiology.org/\">Society for Transparency, Openness, and Reproducibilty in Kinesiology</a> to solve the problem of how to fund and manage <a href=\"https://www.sportrxiv.org/\">SportRxiv</a>.<br><br> Some other problems I am currently working on include changing the academic culture around research integrity through open science at <a href=\"https://www.eur.nl/en\">Erasmus University Rotterdam</a>, and figuring out how best to support online gamers with their mental health at <a href=\"https://www.play-aid.org/\">Play Aid</a>. <br><br>If you have a problem that you think I can help with, <a href=\"mailto:your-email@example.com/|\">drop me an email</a>.\n<br>\n<h2>Selected Works</h2>\n\n<a href=\"https://johnmills.netlify.app/papers/\">Research Papers</a> | <a href=\"https://johnmills.netlify.app/books/\">Books</a> | <a href=\"https://johnmills.netlify.app/media/\">Media</a> | <a href=\"https://johnmills.netlify.app/courses/\">Courses</a> | <a href=\"https://johnmills.netlify.app/employment/\">Employment</a>",
