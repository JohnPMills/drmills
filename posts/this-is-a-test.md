Iï»¿f by some chance you have stumbled across this site, hopefully this post will help it make some sense. Given that I am not promoting this post to Twitter/X, recording a YouTube video or guesting on a podcast to discuss, the chances of you finding this are quite slim. I am okay if it is just me and now you that read this. 

Ever since I was a child, I have found writing therapeutic. Be it poems, songs, stories or anything else, I like expressing myself in written form. I find it hard to live in the present, but it is hard not to be present when writing. Thinking about how to get in keywords or how to phrase the title to maximise views, citations, h-indexes, altmetric scores detracts from the present. It forces you to think into the future. I don't want to do that here.

I know it's unusual in a world of hustling, schilling, and selling, but I'm fortunate to not have to do this. As an academic, I have spent an awfully long time trying to make an awfully long list of people happy. This is a space for me. 

It dawned on me a few weeks ago that since 2008, I have been writing for other people. First it was my lecturers whilst doing my degree, my supervisor and external examiners for my PhD, peer reviewers as a researcher, my bosses, peers, and students as a lecturer, even mostly random strangers on social media. I was required to write for them. To make them happy. To get a high score, a pat on the head, or a digital thumbs up. I always wrote for a specific purpose and audience. I stopped writing for me.

Every year there are talks on how to pep up you research to maximise citations or how social media can boost your academic profile. It's all a bit mucky. I'm not doing that here. There are no analytics, no comments, no digital thumbs up.  No pressure to publish, citations, h-indexes, or anything else.

I will judge my success through my intrinsic satisfaction in making notes here. If I post, it'a because I want to or that I feel I have something I want to say. I'm not going to churn out another piece of text because doing so is a requirement of job security or because Google's algorithym will reward me for it. 

It'll probably be just me and you here -- and I am okay with that.
