I﻿f by some chance you have stumbled across this site, hopefully this post will help it make some sense. Given that I am not promoting this post to Twitter/X, recording a YouTube video or guesting on a podcast to discuss, the chances of you finding this are quite slim. I am okay if it is just me and now you that read this. 

I have spent an awfully long time trying to make an awfully long list of people happy. This is a space for me. It dawned on me a few weeks ago that since 2008, I have been writing for other people. First it was my lecturers whilst doing my degree, my supervisor and external examiners for my PhD, peer reviewers as a researcher, my bosses, peers, and students as a lecturer, even mostly random strangers on social media. I was required to write for them. To make them happy. To get a high score, a pat on the head, or a digital thumbs up. I always wrote for a specific purpose and audience. I rarely wrote for me.

Ever since I was a child, I have found writing therapeutic. Be it poems, songs, stories or anything else, I like expressing myself in written form. I find it hard to live in the present, but it is hard not to be present when writing. Thinking about how to get in keywords or how to phrase the title to maximise views, citations, h-indexes, altmetric scores detracts from the present. It forces you to think into the future. I don't want to do that here, but this is what academic writing has become. Every year there are talks on how to pep up you research to maximise citations or how social media can boost your academic profile. It's all a bit mucky.

W﻿ith all this in mind, there is no space for you to comment here. Like I said and in the nicest possible way, this place is for me not you. There are no analytics, no likes, and no SEO. No pressure to publish, citations, h-indexes, or anything else.

It's probably just me and you -- and I like that.
