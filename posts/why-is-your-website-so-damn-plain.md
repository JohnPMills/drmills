In a world of fancy-pants effects and ever more intricate styling, I wanted to cut straight to the point with this site. I have created many websites, typically with the help of no-code builders like Stackbit (now Netlify Create), WordPress, and Webflow, but I have not built a site from scratch -- until this one. 

This is a static site and because of this, it is pretty bomb proof. The code used to create this site isn't going anywhere soon and if I learn how to deploy from my own server, it'll probably outlive most of the companies used to create the other sites I have built. That's pretty appealling to me. Plus, I like that it is hyper effiecient. The closest thing to a bell or whistle is some very (very) basic css styling, adding fonts that I like. 

Maybe it'll get fancier over time, but if it does, you'll know that it's because I've got fancier in my programming skills.
